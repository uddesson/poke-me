## Resources
I've used the [Pokéapi v2](https://pokeapi.co/), which provides a great open database filled with thousands of Pokémon-related facts and objects.

###### Process
After previously having practiced to fetch information from open API:s with an input field and presenting search results, I wanted to make something different. So I decided on a silly little test, where the user would control the outcome by picking their options. Not searching for them. I ran into a couple of logical problems along the way, mainly how I would give the user several options so they would feel in control - but still limit their options so a matching Pokémon would be found. In the end I think it turned out quite alright.

###### TODO
* Present more facts about the spiritpokémon, maybe a desciption, some stats etc.
* Make some sort of smooth transition for when the result is presented and the loading icon disappears. Same thing with the anchor links. It's kinda rough without any scroll effect.
